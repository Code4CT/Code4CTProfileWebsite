					<h1> About Us </h1>
					We are the grade 10's from COSAT and we are representing Code4CT.We share something and that is the love for coding.We were given the opportunity by Code4CT to learn more about coding and what it is and how it changes lives around the world. We learnt a lot about HTML,CSS and Javasccript.
					We were priviledged enough to be part of the Industry Immersions at Amazon a great company indeed.They welcomed us with warm hands and taught us a lot about Github and everything that we would need to know so that we would be able to finish our project task that we were given.We were given an opportunity to do a profile page for a woman in Tech that we admire and look up to. We chose Maletsabisa Molapo ,she is one of the woman that brings change in this world by helping those that are underpriviledged using something that she loves and enjoys which is coding and using Technology.
					We would love to take this opportunity to thank Amazon for giving us this opportunity to do something that we love for someone we admire and we look up to. A big thank you to all the coaches from Amazon and our mentors from Code4ct for their assistance. Code4CT taught us a lot and for that we will forever be grateful.
